## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the SDK:

```typescript
import { BrianCoinbaseSDK } from "@brian-ai/cdp-sdk";

const sdk = new BrianCoinbaseSDK({
  brianApiKey: "your_brian_api_key",
  coinbaseApiKeyName: "your_coinbase_api_key_name",
  coinbaseApiKeySecret: "your_coinbase_api_key_secret",
});
// Create a wallet
await sdk.createWallet({ networkId: "base-mainnet" });
// Fund your wallet in some way. The brian-ai/cdp-sdk does not support Base sepolia

// Execute a transaction based on a prompt
const txHashes = await sdk.transact("Swap 0.1 ETH for USDC");
console.log("Transaction hashes:", txHashes);
```
